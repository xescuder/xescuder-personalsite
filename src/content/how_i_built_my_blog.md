My previous personal website was based on Hugo and Netlify, thanks to a great colleague [David Ayala](https://www.davidayala.eu/) who allowed me to learn how to create and deploy a website so easily.

That personal website was just a brief introduction of me and what I like, but it ended up becoming a resumé.

After about three months of its creation, I thought I had to add a blog and resources that I use regularly and I think it would be very helpful for other people.

I am a big fan of React and I discovered Gatsby, a static web generator that allows developing pages in React!

Now, on Friday, December 15, 2018, I am creating the first entry of the new web, which I am going to evolve.
