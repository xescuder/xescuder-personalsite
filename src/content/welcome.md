ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, it's great to start this new blog.

This blog is intended to show the best experiences in using software engineering and testing. Also I've a common need to create a resources library and references.

I would thank to my colleague [David Ayala](https://www.davidayala.eu/) who showed me Netlify and the world of JAM Stack.
