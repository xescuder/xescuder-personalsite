A lot of times I've wanted to sort all my photo files. Finally I decided to do it this month. But I didn't expect it was difficult to decide about:

* How do I organize the files in directories?
* What file naming convention should I use?
* There's any tool that can help me to change current file names (a thousands of files)? There's a lot of files named DSCN2394.jpg,   img348358.jpg (it depends on camera, mobile, ...)

To answer these, think yourself, how I would search my content? 

## Repeatable or non repeatable?

### Years and events

The usual way to find anything it is by **years** and then by **event** and **subject/place**. I can (more or less) think that in 2008 it was the baptism of my first child, so then I would expect:

\- To find in 2008 a folder `Noa's Baptism` (baptism is the event, Noa is the subject)

\- To find in 2019 a folder `Italy Holidays` (holidays is the event, Italy is the place)

### Photos not related to a single event

But it's always like this? 

I've spent my holidays for the last 20 years at the same place. Day by day a take photos that are not related to any event (some photos at the beach, some others children playing with their friends at the swimming pool, ...). How can I find these photos? 

You can decide to create a folder 'Holidays at Sant Salvador' for each year. But what I prefer is to see everything in one folder, and let the naming files of photos to say the year of shot.

Another example where I've applied this convention is for my childhood. I've several photos but none of them are for a single event. 

\- `Xavier's Childhood`

\- `Sant Salvador Holidays`

## File naming

Now the big question. How do I name the files? I've seen some people that uses folders as if they are linked to their files as a blood brotherhood. You need to forget that. My files need to be complete by theirselves. Then you can find easily in your operating system, ...

`<YYYYMM>-<Event folder name>-<nnnn>`

## How I've massively organized my photos

### Remove repeated photos

A lot of photos are repeated (with a number at the end -1,  because I did a backup, ...). In the era of sizing is not a problem, we don't spend time to remove repeated photos. 

I've used a tool named **Duplicate File Finder** that finds:

\- Repeated photos (it detects the exact content, despite of different naming or location)

\- Similar photos. How many photos do you've that are practically exactly the same, but only changing a little the position of one hair? ;)

### Remove similar photos

### Renaming files

To help in the automatic naming I suggest to use **Renamer** tool for Mac. It does worth to pay 25$.

Finally, if you've Amazon Premium you can upload your photos free, without limit of storage. You'll see it's great, as you can see photos by specific person, for many persons, ...
