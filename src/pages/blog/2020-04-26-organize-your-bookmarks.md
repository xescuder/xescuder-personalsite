I've used a lot of ways to organize my bookmarks but finally I found the best for me:

\- **Getpocket**. This is where I bookmark anything I find at Internet. You need to signin (with your gmail account for example) and install the plugin at your browser. Everytime you find an interesting page you can click on plugin icon at head of the browser. It appears a window where you can write tags to classify it.

\- **Toby**. Here is where I've organized my most visited pages, like my working sites.  Everytime I open my browser or a tab it appears directly a panel with all my bookmarks.
